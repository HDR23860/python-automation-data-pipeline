# python-automation-data-pipeline
# A Python-based automation pipeline for ingesting, validating, and transforming complex raw datasets into clean, structured outputs. Designed to handle noisy inputs, enforce data quality, and run reliably without manual intervention.

# Key features:
	- Automated ingestion of multi-file raw datasets
	- Config-driven validation and sanity checks
	- Robust failure handling and logging
	- Modular pipeline design for repeated execution
	- Clean, structured outputs ready for downstream systems

# Pipeline flow:
	- Ingest raw input files
	- Validate schema and required fields
	- Apply transformations and standardization
	- Write structured outputs
	- Log successes and failures

# Tech stack:
	- Python
	- YAML-based configuration
	- Structured logging
	- CLI-style execution
